# Changelog

All notable changes to `laravel-astronomy-library` will be documented in this file.

## Version 4.26

### Changed

- Changed:
  - AstronomyLibrary now also keeps deltaT, so that we don't have to recalculate or read it from the database again and again.
  - The calculation of deltaT will now also work when no database is configured.

## Version 4.25

### Added

- Added:
  - Methods to calculate the date of the ascending and descending node of targets in ellipical and parabolic orbits.

## Version 4.24

### Added

- Added:
  - Calculation of aphelion and perihelion date for the planets.

## Version 4.23.1

### Fixed

- Fixed:
    - Fix calculation of delta T in the beginning of the year if the new value is not yet available in the database.

## Version 4.23

### Added

- Added:
  - Calculation of inferior / superior conjunction for inner planets
  - Opposition / conjuntion of outer planets
  - Greatest eastern and western elongation of inner planets.

## Version 4.22

### Added

- Added NearParabolic class, describing an object moving in a near-parabolic orbit. Added method to calculate the coordinates.

## Version 4.21

### Added

- Added Parabolic class, describing an object moving in a parabolic orbit. Added method to calculate the coordinates.

## Version 4.20

### Added

- Added methods to calculate the contrast reserve and the magnification of an object. The contrast reserve tells how easy it is to detect an object.
- If the contrast difference is < 0, the object is not visible, contrast difference < -0.2 : Not visible, -0.2 < contrast diff < 0.1 : questionable, 0.10 < contrast diff < 0.35 : Difficult, 0.35 < contrast diff < 0.5 : Quite difficult to see, 0.50 < contr diff < 1.0 : Easy to see, 1.00 < contrast diff : Very easy to see

## Version 4.19.1

  - Time::getWinter()
  - Time::getSpring()
  - Time::getSummer()
  - Time::getAutumn()

## Version 4.12

### Added

- Add method to calculate the rectangular coordinates of the sun
- Add RectangularCoordinates class

## Version 4.11

### Added

- Add method to calculate the atlas page corresponding to equatorial coordinates.

## Version 4.10

### Added

- Add method to calculate the constellation when the coordinates are given.  The constellation is returned as 3 characters (Latin name).  The migration should be re-exported and run to be able to run this method.

## Version 4.9.3

### Changed

- Fix the calculation of the altitude graph if the equatorial coordinates of yesterday and tomorrow are also given.

## Version 4.9.2

### Changed

- Add the equatorial coordinates of yesterday and tomorrow to the target (sun).

## Version 4.9.1

### Changed

- Use \Carbon\Carbon everywhere in the code

## Version 4.9

### Added

- Add methods to calculate the equatorial coordinates of the sun.

## Version 4.8

### Added

- Add methods to calculate the apparent place of a star, using the Ron-VondrÃ¡k expression. The calculations take into account the perturbations caused by the planets, the precession and the nutation.

## Version 4.7

### Added

- Add precession method for EquatorialCoordinates to calculate the precession for a given date with low accuracy.  The proper motion of the star is taken into account for the calculation of the precession.
- Add precessionHighAccuracy for EquatorialCoordinates method to calculate the precession for a given date with high accuracy.  The proper motion of the star is taken into account for the calculation of the precession.
- Add precessionHighAccuracy for EclipticalCoordinates method to calculate the precession for a given date with high accuracy.  The proper motion of the star is not taken into account for the calculation of the precession.

### Changed

- The constructor of the EquatorialCoordinates class now also takes the epoch of the coordinate as argument.  If the epoch is not given, the standard epoch of 2000.0 is taken.
- The constructor of the EquatorialCoordinates class now also takes the proper motion (in RA and in dec) as arguments.  If the proper motion is not given, the value of 0.0 is taken.

## Version 4.6

### Added

## Version 3.0

### Changed

- GeographicalCoordinates class now inherits from the abstract Coordinates class.
- Moved GeographicalCoordinates to deepskylog\AstronomyLibrary\Coordinates.
